            <h3>Writing Advice</h3>
            <p>Use any of the .bg-color classes to add a background color to the navbar.</p>
            <p>Tip: Add a white text color to all links in the navbar with the .navbar-dark class, or use the 
                .navbar-light class to add a black text color.In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers 
                and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and the Goblet of Fire, but also through 
                people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him, depriving him of freedom and choice.
                 For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s life, keeping from him 
                 knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter and the 
                 Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s 
                 letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts
                  Express; and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again, in 
                  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while attempting to protect Harry from
                   perceived danger, as Snape observes: “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to
                    keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, 
                    unknowingly drive Harry toward his destiny by attempting to control or to direct his life, while
                     themselves controlled and directed by fate.</p>

    <h2>How do I unify my ideas in a paragraph?</h2>
    <p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.

        Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.
        
        In academic writing, the topic sentence nearly always works best at the beginning of a paragraph so that the reader knows what to expect:
        
        The embrace of Twitter by politicians and journalists has been one of its most notable features in recent years: for both groups the use of Twitter is becoming close to a requirement.
        
        —Paul Bernal, “A Defence of Responsible Tweeting”
        
        This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter. The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence. By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.</p>

        <h4>How long should a paragraph be?</h4>
        <p>Paragraphs vary in length depending on the needs of the paragraph. Usually, paragraphs are between one-third and two-thirds of a page double spaced.

            A series of long paragraphs can make prose dense and unpleasant to read. Check any paragraph that is a page or longer to see whether it would work better as two or more paragraphs. Break it at a logical place (e.g., where your focus shifts), and see whether you need to create new topic sentences to make the shift clear.
            
            Also look out for short paragraphs only two or three sentences long. They make academic writing seem disjointed or skimpy. Try combining short paragraphs with the preceding or following paragraph if they share the same topic. Short paragraphs might also need to be developed further. Make sure that nothing vital has been omitted.</p>

        <h4>How do I make my ideas flow in a paragraph?</h4>
        <p>“Flow” is a word used to describe the way a paragraph moves from idea to idea. This movement occurs both within the paragraph and between paragraphs. The best overall strategy to enhance flow within a paragraph is to show connections. A variety of simple techniques can help you to clarify those connections and thereby communicate your intended logic. Deliberate repetition of key words helps. Reiterating the focus of your analysis by repeating key words or synonyms for key words enhances the overall flow of the paragraph. In the following example, the repetition of the key words “Canadian,” “nation,” and “communication” allows for clear flow throughout the paragraph.

            It’s perhaps not surprising that Marshall McLuhan, the most influential communications expert of the twentieth century, was a Canadian. As a nation, we have been preoccupied with forging communication links among a sparse, widespread population. The old Canadian one-dollar bill, with its line of telephone poles receding to the distant horizon, illustrates this preoccupation. Year after year we strive to maintain a national radio and television broadcasting system in the face of foreign competition. We have been aggressive in entering the international high technology market with our telecommunications equipment.
            
            —Margot Northey, Impact: A Guide to Business Communication
            
            While the deliberate repetition of a key word is a useful tool, you generally want to avoid repeating an entire idea. In particular, avoid ending a paragraph by making the same point you made in the topic sentence. This type of reiteration stalls or disrupts the development of ideas as well as the logical progression to the next paragraph. Strategic use of pronouns such as it, they, and this keeps the focus on the ideas announced at the beginning of the paragraph—as long as they are clearly linked to specific nouns. In the following example the antecedent is underlined and its corresponding pronoun is in bold.</p>
